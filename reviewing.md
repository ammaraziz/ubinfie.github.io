title: Reviewing a Post
---

This document is aimed at [Editorial Board Members]({% link about.md %}) who will be reviewing pull requests for this site.

When you review a post we expect you to go through roughly the following checklist:

1. Check the post's language for spelling and clarity

   There are differences in how English is written and spoken globally, so please be mindful of this when reviewing; there is no need to explicitly force the hegemony of British English, or any specific flavour.

1. If there is technical content (programming, command line commands) please consider running these yourself to check for their accuracy
1. Ensure that citations are included where relevant and formatted properly.
1. Check that everyone who was in the thread and wishes to be acknowledged is included in the contributors list.
1. Ensure the formatting and layout is correct. This can generally be accomplished just by looking at the GitHub rendering of the markdown document.
1. If there are CI tests, please ensure they pass before you merge.
